This ineffable union (Eph. v. 32) is brought about by the Spirit
01 Christ in the spiritual regeneration 01 Baptism (Rom. vi. 17 5
xiii r4; Gah ii. 15,16; v. 25 3 pr i. 235 iv. 4, 22-24;
Col i. 18; Tit. iii. 6), which is at once a type and symbol 01 our
fellowship in the Death and Resurrection 01 the Lord (Rom. vi.
173 Gal. ii. 15, 16 ; Eph. i. 2 3), an incorporation into the Church
or congregation 01 the faithful (Rom. xiii. 14 3 Eph. i. 22, 23 ;
iv. 4,16; Col. i. 18), and anew birth into that immortal and sinless
lise into which Christ Himsels has passed (Gal. ii. 15, 16, dre). ’
It is not, however, the water 01 Baptism which draws down upon ’
the baptized this gili 01 grace in its iulness, but the saith 01 the
receiver ; the Holy Spirit will not rest on any who receive this
Sacrament without the proper dispositions (1 Tim. iii. 2), and

ᾖ thus, whether baptized in infancy or in riper age, the members 01
Christ must be carelul to live according to the grace they have
received (Rom. vi. 173 Col. ii. 155 1 Tim. iii 2). Baptism apart
l'rom effort and diligence will not produce the fruits 01 virtue, even
11 it may be said to convey the remissiori 01 sins (1 Tim. iii. 6).
Nevertheless, great are the blessings 01 Baptism ; without it we
cannot receive the Holy Spirit (ι Tim. iii. 6); in it we obtain
the first gilt 01 His grace, the firstfruits and earnest 01 the im·
morial life which we are hereaster to share with Christ (Gal. iii
13, 143 Eph. i. 13, 14; 22, 233 Col. ii. 12 ; 1Thess. iv. 8).
The Holy Spirit, Who is the Spirit 01 the Son, yet coessential
and coeternal with the Father (Rom. viii. 11), Who anointed the
Man Christ at His Baptism (Heb. i. 9) and Whose grace was
received by Him for man at His Ascension (Eph. iv. 9), is the
Agent 01 our entire restoration, lrom the new birth 01 the lont
to the final entrance on eternal lile (Rom. viii. ²3 Gal. ii. 15, 16,·
et passim). In the present state (uili b) the regenerate occupy a
kind 01 border·land between two worlds‚ the present and the future
(Gal. ii. 15, κός iii 20 3 v. 25). By virtue 01 our regeneration and
union with Christ we have already passed into the future lile
(Gal. v. 24); we already enjoy the adoption 01 sons, which consists
iu the gift 01 immortality (Rom. viii. 15: Gal. iii. 27, ²85 iv· 5) 3
we already possess the sanctifying power 01 the Spirit (1 Cor. vi.
11). Yet at present we are sons of God by anticipation rather a,
than in actual fruition (Rom. viii. 15 ; Gal. ii. 16), we are infants , ᾖ
in the lil‘e 01 the Spirit (Rom. viii. 15 ; Gal. ii. 16); we are justified ’
only by saith. Justification by the works 01 the law or by works
01 any kind is impossible, by reason 01 the weakness 01 our mortal
