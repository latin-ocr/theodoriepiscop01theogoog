commentaries¹. There was little inducement for the scribes to
multiply copies of writings condemned by the voice of the Church,
when the excitement created by the controversy of the “Three
Chapters '’ had once subsided ; whilst itis at least possible that
many of the existing MSS. sbared the fate which is said to have
overtaken the works of Theodore’s master Diodore’. Moreover
Theodore's exposition of S. Paul, even if it escaped the hands
both of Arians and Catholics, may easily have been eclipsed by
the popular and comparatively unsuspected commentaries of S.
Chrysostom and Theodoret. An occasional copy however lingered

in the librarios of the orthodox East down to the age of the
Greek eatenists, some of whom ventured to incorporate the more

striking remarks of the great Antiocheae Interpreter'. It is
scarcely to be hoped that a single MS. of the original still exista.

fflsss his Church, found shelter and an eager acceptance amongst the Nes-

conmen- torians, who at an early date translated thern into Syriae and other

Μ· Oriental languages⁴. That the commentaries upon S. Paul were
among these translations there are two witnesses to shew 3 the
Egyptian priest Abulbarakit [t ao. 1365], who ina list of ecele-
siastical writings extant in Arabio in his own day mentions an
exposition by “Theodore the Commentator'’ of “certain Epistlesof .
