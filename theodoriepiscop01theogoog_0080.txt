the r‘ise ol Gnosticism in Apostolic times (r Tim. iii. 16). Nor
isit only to questions ol Church history that Theodora pays
attention. He remarks upon points ol geography, archaeology,
ritual, literature (Gal. iv. 255 Phil. iii 5 ; 1 Tim. iii. 13-15 3·

ir. 75 2 Tim. iv. 10)—all however in strict subordination to his
general purpose ol illustrating S. Paul

system, and its relation to πίστις (Gelu. 6, 13—143 Eph. iv. 23

Col iii. 14, 153 rTim. ii. 4; 2 Tim. iv. 8 3 Philem. a). Much

tact and knowledge of human nature are occasionally shewn in

the application os the Epistles to daily lise; eg. Phil, arg.
(“evenit de primatu,” &c.), Eph. v. ²9 (“ non absolute ampliorem

ad viros,'’ &c.), r Tim. ii. 10 (“ super hoc necessarium erat,” &c.),

1 Tim. iii. a, &c This practical interest leads him osten to teser

to the conditions os the Church in his own day 3 and in the
teaching ol the first century h'e discerns wholesome lessons lor the

clergy and laity os the fifth (r Tim, arg.‚· Philem., arg). It yields

salutary warnings against the spirit of persecution on the one hand

(Gal. vi. ιο), and ol latitudinarianism'on the other (Phili 18).

S. Paul's allegorical interpretation of a passage ol Old Testament

history gives Theodore occasion to attack the erroneous allegorizing

os the school ol Origen (Gal iv. 24). S. Paul’s direction that a
“Bishop’' shall be “the husband ol one wise '' opens the way to a

long examination os the prevailing opinion as to second marriages

(ι Tim. iii. 2). S. Paul's mode ol addressing Philemon is con-

trasted with the arrogance of certain of the higher clergy os the

existing Church, his treatment os the relations between master and

slave, with the salse liberalism which would destroy the divinely
established order ol society (Eph. vi. 93 Col. iv. 13 Philem., arg).

Ol the precise value ol Theodore’s commentary from atheo Worth ol

logical point os view it is not so easy to speak. Certainly he ¹²3⁵ theolo-

does not lose sight os the theological aspectos S. Paul's Epistles. §gildi-s.
Theology iu his eyes is paramo'unt; and il he pays close attention
to grammar and sequence, this is for the sake of the theological
truths which he believes himself thus the better able to elicit. His
longest and most elaborate comments‚ if we except the Pastbral
Epistles, are strictly theological (Rom. viii. 19;ῐ>(· 14 ς Gal. i.
3-53 ii 15, 16, iii. 235 Eph. i. ro, 233 Phil. ii. 8, 9; Col. i.

with the deep and ever present interest which it displays in
