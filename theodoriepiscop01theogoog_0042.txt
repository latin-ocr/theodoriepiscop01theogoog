3οι deponite C, deponere H. Some at least οι these divergences
seem to forbid the belief that our MSS. were copied from a
common original. On the other hand, having regard to their
general agreement, even in minute errors, we may,1 venture to
think, suppose that the MSS. from which C and Η were derived
had themselves been transcribed from the same copy. If the
Harley and Corbie MSS. are not sister documents, they may cer-
talnly be related to each other as first cousins.

occasionally dropt per homoeoteleuton (e. g. on pp. 40, 52, 56, 61,
