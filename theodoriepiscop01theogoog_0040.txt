THE MSS. ΟΝ WHICH THIS EDITION IS BASED. xxix

tolas uenerabilis apostoli Pauli exordium ut freret praecesserunt,

composui, nunc totum quod congruum uisum est scribendo, nunc
quod nimium erat abbreuiando, nunc quod parum mihi uidebatur
sicut ratio postulabat ampliando. quod simul in uno loco duorum

In the body of the compilation 1 have noticed the names
of Origen, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustius, Leo, Gregory‚ Bede,
Haymo‚ lanfranc, Ivo, Anselm, and Lambert (l). The identifi-
cation of the sources becomes less frequent as the work proceeds,
and in the commentary on 2 Tim, Tit, Philemon, very few names
occur. “ Ambrosius ” appears to be (1) Ambrosiaster (Rom, r
and 2 Cor.); (2) Theodore (Gal-Philemon, but not in all cases);
(3) the writer of the commentary on Hebrews printed in the Paris
edition of S. Ambrose'(1632).

The extrccts from Theodore agree pretty closely with those
which are to be found in the printed Lanfranc 3 any important¹
divergences have been pointed out in the footnotes. 1 have used
the Emmanuel ΜΒ, which was the first that came to my know-
ledge; but the copy in the University Library has been subse
quently compared throughout, without exhibiting however any
noteworthy variants
