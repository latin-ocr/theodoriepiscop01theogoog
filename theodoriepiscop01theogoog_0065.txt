the Patriarchate of Aquileia were doubtless in the first instance
content to oppose the principle of Theodore’s condemnation
without entering into the question of his orthodoxy. But Popes
Vigilius and Pelagius II. expressly appealed to the works of
Theodore; and the Roman deacon Rusticus wrote or proposed
to writea trmtise¹ in which a discussion of Theodore's distinctiva
theology‚ based upon extracts from his writings, must have found
place. In North Africa, where from the first Justinian’s edict en-
conntered a determined resistance, attention seems to have been
still more widely drawn to the books which had brought upon the
mernory of Theodore the fanatical displeasure of the Emperor„
The African Bishop Pontianus indeed in his letter to Justinian
(ab. 546) avows that these were as yet unknown tohis country-
men ⁸. But within the next two years Facundus, then at Constanti·
nople, quotes copiously from them; and as in his preface he com·
plains of the inm translatorum ³, it may be assumed that some
attempts had already been rnade to clothe portions of Theodore’s
writings ina Latin dress. It has been remarked⁴ that no reference

· is made by Facundus to that part of the commentary on S. Paul

which is represented in our translation ; and it is certainly against
his claim to be the translator that wherever he quotes the minor
Epistles the revised Vulgate is used, with only a slight admixture

' of Old Latin readings⁵. On the other hand, although the solitary

passage which he cites from Theodore’s exposition of the Epistle
to the Romans is perhaps as Prof. Jacobi says⁸ too short to admit
of a serious comparison with the style of our translation, it is im·
possible not to be struck by the general resemblance in manner
and occasional agreement in diction between the latter and
the various Theodorean extracts scattered through the work of
Facundus ⁷. If Facundus himself was not the translator, it isat
