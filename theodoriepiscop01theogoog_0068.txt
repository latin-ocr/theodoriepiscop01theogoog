whilst his Greek origin, and varied learning, coupled perhaps
with a lengthened residence in the West, would have in'sured him

η the literary qualifications necessary for the task. There was
however no lack of Greek scholarship in Spain during the century
which followed the time of S. Isidore, nor were occasional
opportunities of intercourse with the East wanting ¹. The indi-
cations of this translation having obtained circulation in Spain
are doubtless faint'. There is no direct evidence that it was
used by the Adoptianists‚ although if they had known of its exist·
enee, it would have suited their purpose to cite more than one of
its Christological passages. The Spanish commentator Claudius
Taurinensis (t 839)¹ shews no traca of its influence in his exposi-
tion of the Epistle to the Galatians. But if the Latin Theodore
was circulated in Spain at all, it is at least possible that the work
was executed in the Peninsula itself, the original having been
brought thither direct from Constantinople.

Viewing the question then from an a priori standpoint, we qonctu·
shall assign the translation either to the fifth, sixth, or seventh ΜΕ·
century, according as we suppose its author to have been a
Pelagiara a Semipelagian, an opponent of Justiniau’s edict, or a
precursor of Adoptianism. ’

But this large field may be narrowed by taking into considera-
tion the facts already ascertained with reference to the internal
characteristics and early circulation of the work. Its latinity -
seems to be of too late a type to justify the belief that it proceeded
from a Pelagian or even a semipelagian writer anterior to the 6th
century. Moreover it abounds in forms andconstructions strongly
indicative of a North African parentage. The version of S. Paul’s
Epistles with which its author was familiar contained such a large
preponderance of Old Latin readings as to point distinctly to‘ the 1
same locality. From Africa the translation might readily have
passed into Spain on the one hand, and into Italy on the other;
