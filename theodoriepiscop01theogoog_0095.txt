s'tate3 it can be obtained only through the grace of the Spirit,

and in its perfectiori it belongs to that future world which our

faith contemplates, and where we hope to be free from all mu-

tability and death (Rom. ix. 32, 333 Gal. ii. 13, 16; iv. 245

Tit. iii. 6, 7). Meanwhile, through the operation 01 the Holy

Spirit, we are enabled to mould our mortal life into an imitation

01 the deathless state into which we have been symbolically
admitted (Rom. vi. 12-143 Tit ii. 13, 14). Frequent Com-
munion, preceded by a careful examination of the mind, is
incumbent on all who seelr this end. In the Holy Mysteries 'the

faithful receive [the Body and] Blood 01 Christ, present therein by

virtue 01 a spiritual change. All the benefits which result from

the Death of the Lord are thus conveyed to penitent recipients,
especially the forgiveness of past sins, however great, and the co-
operation of the Spirit in their endeavours to attain to amendment

of life (1 Cor. x. 3-5; xi. 28, 34). Nothing but deadly and habitual

sin should deter the baptized from this most fruitful means 01 grace.

The Last (viii) The παρουσία is the great hope of the Church and of creation
‘stringe-U (Col. iii. 43 1 Thess. ii 19). Our Lord’s missioh is repeatedly
, represented by S. Paul as finding its realization in the future life
i‘fi· Ι (00111113,Ερ11..1.3,’4;11.7). When He appears, the work of
. the Spirit will attain its perfectiori. Then will have come the

1 moment 01 0111 tnrer regeneration (Gal. iv. 24). By the power 01

the Spirit the body will be raised, and endowed with immortality

(Rom. viii. 2; Gal. iii. 35 vi. 18; Eph. i. 43 Phil. i. 19); our
adoption (Rom. viii. 195 Gal. iii. 27, 28) and our translation

into the Kingdom of the Adopted Son (Col. i. 13) will then at

length be perfected. Further‚ we shall be set free from the vicissi-

tudes 01 mortality, and thenceforth guarded by the full indwelling

of the Spirit from the possibility of a relapse (Gal. ii. 15, 16).

⁴ We shall then need no law, because being immortal we shall

no longer be in danger of falling into s‘m (Rom. v. 17 ; ix.

32, 33 ; r Cor. xv. 565 Gal. iv. 1-3; v. 17 ; Eph. i. 18;

Col. i. 223 iii. 53 r Tim. i. 9). Nor will our blessedness be

merely negative; the perpetual presence in us of the Spirit of

grace will be the pledge 01 all good things (Gal. iv. 29 ; Eph. i.

13, 14). Union with Christ and with God, union in Christ and

in God with our fellowmen and with all creation, enjoyment

01 the Divine glory, an insatiable love of virtue and the power

to attain to it without pain or toil, an eternal abode with Christ
in Heaven-these are amongst the elements 01 the perfectiori
