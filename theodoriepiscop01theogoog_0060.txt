clear, therefore, that at this time the Abbey of Fulda possessed
a MS. in which a portion of the Iatin Theodore appeared under
the name of Ambrose. It is equally certain that in this MS.
the work of Ambrosiaster was carried on to the ¹end of Ephesiam,
his place being usurped by Theodore only in the eight following
epistles. Whilst sedulius had access to the Latin Theodore
on Galatians, in the Fnlda ‘Ambrose' Theodore‘did not begin
before Philippians. The fact is remarkable as shewing that
the substitution of Theodore for Ambrosiaster had in some
copies been partial‚ in others coextensive with the limits of oui
translation. Are we to infer that the translation, if hythe same
hand throughout, was not all produced at¹ the same time, the
commentary on Galatians and Ephesians being the first instal- .
ment of the work, and the remainder having originally followed
by itselfh Or did the translator begin with the Epistle to the
Philippians, perhaps because the commentary on this and the
following Epistles offered more abundant illustrations of Theo
dore's peculiar theology? In any case, we have in the work of
Rabanus distimt evidence that, so far as the last eight epistles
are concemed‚ the Latin translation had found its way to Germany
in connexion with the commentary of Ambrosiaster before the
middle of the ninth century.
