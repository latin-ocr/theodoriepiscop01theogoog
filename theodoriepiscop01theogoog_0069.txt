its origin. Lastly‚ in the second hall ol the sixth century the
Church os North Africa is known to have been passing through a
crisis most favourahle' to the production ol such a work. Mariy ol
her clergy, a t'ew perhaps ol her educated laity‚ were suffering
persecution imprisonment or exile in behalf oi Ibas, Theodoret,
and Theodore. What wonder if the far-lamed Commentator was

studied by the sufferas, or if an attempt was made to justify their
attitude by the translation ol one of his most important works into

the vulgar tonguel, The translator may have learnt to sympa-
thize with the teaching as weh as with the ecclesiastical troubles ol
his author; and in this case aster the lashion ol the times he
would naturally have endeavoured to gain a hearing for him
among Iatinspeaking Churchmen by placing his work under the
sanction ol a great Westem name. γ

Is the above conclusions are sound² the work os translation was
probably accomplished in the interval between the publication ol
· Justinian’s edict and the Emperoffs death (a D. 544—565). That
the name oi the translator will ever be discovered is perhaps
unlikely. There are objections to the claims ol Facundus, Juni-
lius, and Primasius ot Adrumetum; and of the other Aln'can
opponents ol the edict we know too little to form au opinion.
The unequal execution of the work, altemating between a fair
imitation os the style os contemporary writers aud a slipshod laxity
suggestive ol haste or inexperience, leads to the supposition that
we have belore us the first and perhaps the only literary effort
os a person used merely to the language ot' the Church or
ol the law courts, a Bishop, or it may have been a jurist, who
had recourse to the assistance of the pen when his mouth was
stopped by the severity ol the Emperor¹. That his work has
survived is due to the protection of S· Ambrose’s name, which
has¹ covered at once the faults ol the latinity and the theological
eccentricities ol the original.

¹ In my study ol the translation it might account l'or the extreme in·
has more thau once occurred to me equalityof his work, without leaving

that the writer may have been a per- unexplained his African Latinityand ξ

son ol Greek descent, who had passed evident familiarity with the Latin ver·
the eater part oi his lile in N. Alrica. sions ol S. Paul's Epistles.
