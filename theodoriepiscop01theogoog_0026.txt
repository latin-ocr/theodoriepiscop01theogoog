dominates, both in the named and in the anonymous portions.
Theodore is next in the frequency ol the extracts which bear his
name ; but his commentaries have been used with cantion, ag,
ol his interesting but questionable remarks on Philipp. ii. 5—11,
scarcely anything hasbeen preserved, whilst the exposition os
Colossi ις, sq. is quoted iu part, but with an eager disclaimer
on the part os the catenist ol any sympathy with his views.

Out ol about ¹30 excerpts from Theodore 1 have noticed only
some 30 which are assigned to him by the catenist with the
introductory formula Θεόδωρος δέ φησιν or the like ; of these 21
,are in the catena on the Epistle to the Ephesians. In the great
maiority of instances the name is added in the margin in the
same hand as that in which the catena itself is written; whilst in
the body ol the catena the paragraph is introduced with the
words datos [tt] φησίν, oris lest without introduction of any kind.
The phrase ἄλλος, aet, occurs in 54 instances ; the wholly un-
appropriated extracts are lew, most os those which seem to be
such being in lact mere continuations ol comments previously
assigned. .Very occasionally the marginal ascription proves to bc
in error, anda passage marked as Theodore's appears to be no ’
part ol his world, or aTheodorean fragment is assigned to another
writer⁸3 more frequently, a Theodorean excerpt is attached to
'a comment of Chrysostom⁸, or Chrysostom succeeds to 'iheodore
without due notice os the change. But on the whole the identi-
fication in the margin of this MS, so far as our author is con-
cerned, is singularly accurate and trustworthy.
