’ As lar back as the end os the seventeenth century (1686-90),
the Benedictine editors ol S. Ambrose, in their presace to the ·
commentary ol the Ambrosian Hilary, had called attention rothe
circumstance that a MS. formerly belonging to the monastery os
Corbie contained aLatin commentary identical with the Ambro
¹sinster’s on the Epistles to the Romans and Corinthians, but
altogether distinct from the latter and from every other known
’ exposition in its treatment ol the remaining nine Epistles ¹. The
researches ,ol Dom (now Cardinal) J. B. Pitra led him toa
carehil examination ol this Ms.; and believing himself to have
sound in it a genuine worlr ol S. Hilary ol Poitiers, he pub-
lished in 1852¹ the cornmentary on Galatians Ephesians and
Philemon entire, together with a collationes the commentary on
*the intervening Epistles with the copious and almost continuous
extracts from it which the Benedictines had already' detected in
the printed compilation of Rabanus Maurus, where they appeared,
as in the Corbie MS„ under the name of Ambrose. Pitra's pub-
lication was accompanied by an elaborate defence os his theory
as to the authorship os the new-found exposition; and this theory
was accepted by more than one os his reviewers ⁴. It was,
