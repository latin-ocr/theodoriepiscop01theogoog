ascribes the frrst of these defects not so much to the peculiarity
of Theodore’s diction as to (a) the length of his periods, (b) the
frequent use of parentheses, (c) the habit of repeating himself and
at the same time introducing fresh matter to such an extent that
the repetition is often more lengthy than the original statement,
(d) a partiality for oblique cases and participles These criticisms
were based on a study of Theodore's exposition of Genesis and
of certain of his polemical works. In the newly recovered com·
and mentary on the minor Prophets, Fritzsche¹ has remarked a fourth

and forms of period His Greek, he adds, in itself is excellent.
applicante All these imperfectioris are distinctly visible in the present
ἒὲηῗᾷζζῖξ work, even through the·veil of the translation. The translator
has illiosyncracies of his own which arc dealt with in another part
of this introduction (p. xxxvi sq.) ; buton the whole he is faithful
to his author and makes no attempt to hide his blemishes. Indeed
he may be said to exaggerate them, for, where comparison is pos
sible, the Latin proves to be more obscure, more diffuse and harsh
than the Greek, and at least as full of verbal repetition. It may
in part, though certainly not altogether, be owing to the clumsi-
ness of the Latin medium that one rises fruma perusal of these
commentaries with a feeling in which weariness and interest are
strangely mingled. Seldom is so much originality of thought
to be found in connexion with so dull a manner; or such great
acuteness with such needless and ambiguous iteration.
Causesof These faults of style, so far as they must be laid to
tahffypgssuh· Theodore's charge, are in some measure no doubt the natural
rnanner. result of his restless over-productIveness3 in some measure also
they may be due to the carly training he had received from the
rhetor Libanius. lt is worthy of remark that Photius, without
any apparent intention of comparing the master with his pupil,
finds in Libanius several of the faults which he had found iu
Theodore'. Diodore's writings, on the other hand, seem to have
been distinguished by cleamess and lucidity¹; but in the matter
of style it was perhaps natural that Theodore should follow his

earlier instructor. Yet I am disposed to look for the principal
