There are sundry indications that the commentaries on S. Paul’s Rsasons
Epistles belong to a much later period of Theodore's literary life. ¹'0‘ 1³¹²&ssss

that the anonymous ‘F ather’ to whom¹ Euthalius owed his division 31:¹3¹ ἓξὲξ
of the Epistles into κεφάλαια was none other than the famous '
but suspected Bishop of Mopsuestia This theory receives some
support from the following facts now brought to light by the
Δ recovery of the latin T heodore. (ι) At r Thess. v. r, where the
6th Euthalian chapter of that Epistle begins, Theodore has the
remark “ alterum hic incipit capitulum.” (2) Though 1 have not
noticed any other clear instance of this use of the word capitulum ²,
there is a very general coincidence between the beginnings of the
Euthalian chapters and the successive steps which Theodore seems
to take in unfolding the arguments of the several Epistles (3)
Both the ὑποθέσεις and the headings of the κεφάλαια occasionally
accord in a striking way with Theodore's judgements or modes of
expression, e g. the hypotheses to Ephesians and Colossinus both
begin ταύτην ἐπιστέλλει dard Ῥώμης, οὔπω μὲν ἓωρσκῶς αὐτούς,
ἀκούσας δὲ περὶ αὐτῶν ; and the third chapter of the latter Epistle
is headed περὶτῆς ἓν Χριστῷ [κτίσεως καὶ] ἅνακτίσεως τῆς κατὰ
revideam Θεοῦ, where if we omit the bracketed words the re-
maiuder will exactly represent the drist of Theodore’s singular
exposition. Now the original work upon which Euthalius drew
appears to have been executed no. 396. If it proceeded from
Theodore’s peu, may we not reasonably see iu it his first step io
preparation for carrying out the great project of commenting upon
aeaut? Such a supposition will place thetcommencement of
