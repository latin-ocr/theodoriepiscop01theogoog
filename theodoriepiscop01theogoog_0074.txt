taries on the Pauline Epistles were written at the instance of six
friends. The commentary on Romans was addressed to one
Eusebius, the commentary on Corinthians to a namesake Theo .
dorus3 Eustratius elicited the exposition of the Epistles to the
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossiaus; whilst we owe

the commentary on Thessalouiaus to a James, theton Timothy

to a Peter, that ou Titus and Philemon to a Cyrinus, who
seems also to have drawn forth the commentary on the Epistle

to the Hebrews. This account receives some confirmation ,from

the language of Theodore himself in the argument of his com·
meumry on Philem0n¹. If trustworthy, it suggests that the com-
mentaries followed one another at varying intervals of time.
With the exception of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistles
seem to have been treated in the order in which they now stand.
The Epistles to the Romans arrd to the Hebrews were among the
first to be dealt with (comm. on Gal. iii. 23 3 iv. 24); Galatians
preceded Ephesians (Eph i. 4), Philippians and “nearly all'’ the
other Epistles came before the first Epistle to Timothy (1 Tim. i.

3, 45 iii. 8), the first Epistle to Timothy before the Epistle to
Titus (Tit. i. 5). The commentary upon the Epistle to Philemon ⁰
with its singularly interesting and valuable argument may perhaps ,
be regarded as the crowning effort of the Interpreter's expository
power.
