(see'thearguments to Gal, Eph., Phil, Tit, Philemon). (b) As
the commentary proceeds, there are at intervals brief summaries
of the ground already traversed, and occasionallya planning out
and subdivision of that which remains. Examples may be found
under Gal. ii. 143 Eph v. 213 1Tim. v. 3 3 but· the practice is
in fact of constant recurrence. (c) Theodore is careful never
to let the thread of his exposition drop, from the very beginning
of each Epistle to its close. Almost every paragraph is linked
to the foregoing by some brief note of sequence, if not by a more
direct indication of the order in which the thought flows on. The
result to the reader is a sense of unity and cohesion which in
commentaries as brief as Theodore’s is often lost or marred.
(d) The more difficult or obscure arguments are worked out in
detail, with varying success, but for the most part with a genuine
effort to grasp the mind of the Apostle. Witness our authors
Ι treatment of such passages as Gal. 1i. 17-193 iii. 16, iv. 8, sq.3
iv. 253 Eph. v. 29—333 Phit‘· ιι. 7-113 Coti 13-203 ii.
21-233 1Tim.' ιι. 14-153 v. 23, sq.
Hisrrear· Closely connected with Theodore’s regard to the thought of ·
ffollztdml tlte sacred writer is his endeavour to deal with the historical
questoris questions and matters of fact with which the Epistles are bound
up or which the text suggests. This historical interest, although
secondary, is everywhere prominent Thus Theodore decides on
general principles that the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colos-
sians were written to Churches which S. Paul had not previously
visited¹3 and he is led by this conclusion to assign the former
Epistle to a date which places it in the earliest group of S. Paul's
letters ¹. He expresses himself in favour of two visits of S Paul
to Rome, and tvo Roman imprisonments⁸. He has a distinct
opinion to offeras to the meaning of the “ Epistle from Laodicea‘.”
He enquires in passing into such points of early ecclesiastical
history as the poverty of the Church of Jemsalem (Gal. ii. 9-10) 3
the position in the primitive Church of women (Phil. iv. 23 ι Tim.
ii. 12) and of slaves (Philem. arg), the foundation of the Ephe·
sian and Colossian Churches (Eph. arg, Col. i. 7), the extent,
results and cessation of spiritual gifts (Gal. iii. 2 3 Eph. iii. 5 3
v. 143 r Thess. v. 19-203 2 Thess. ii. 6)3 the gradual ex.
tension of the Episcopate, and appropriation of the title ἐπίσκοπος
to the highest office in the Church (Phil. i 1—23 1 Tim iii. 8)3
