As EXHIBITED IN HIS EXPOSITION OF S. PAUL. lxxxvii

of much of the prophetie and typical import of the Holy Scrip-
tures is due to an excessive jealousy for their literal truth. Of
all that the Church had declared to be of faith, he was the staunch
defendet ; auditis characteristic of his honest belief in the Nicene
doctrines that he is said to have converted to the Catholic Church
⁵ the Arian population of his diocese. But where the Church had
not spoken, he conceived himself free to speculate or to reproduce
the speculations of his school, little dreaming that in these wander-
ings of his restless mind across the frontier of ascertained truth he
was heading on dangerous and hereafter to be forbidden ground.

(ii) His errors are mainly due to an imperfect realization of Source ot
the nature and extent of human sin. With Theodore sin is agfflffie·
weakness rather than a disease, a negative rather than a positive
evil Mortality is the great enemy of man, the recovery of im·
mortality is his greatest hope3 death is the sting of sin, rather than
sin of death. With the true estimate of the evil of sin, the neces-
sity for an actual Incamation of the Etemal Word disappears 3 a '9 , .
man indissolubly united to God through the permanent indwelling &iulg-y
of the Word suffices for the work of vanquishing death. The
present forgiveness of sins is not ignored in Theodore’s system,
for it already had its place in the ancient symbols; but this article
of the faith is almost pushed out of view by the hope of the
resurrection life. The Pauline doctrine of justification by saith
resolves itself into the fact of the believers daily struggle towards
perfectiou3 the Sacrifica of the Cross is principally regarded as a
necessary step in the transition of the Second Adam from mor· -
tality to the immortal and immutable. Even the work of the
Holy Spirit, into which Theodore enters with remarkable fulness,
finds its crowning glory in the resurrection of the body and the
consequences of dre resurrection3 the sinlessness of the future
life is secondary in his view to its perfect freedom from change
and death. It is not that he does not attach due importance to
the moral side of human nature3 his constant assertion of the
αὐτεξούσιον abundantly proves the contrary. But he fails to re·
cognize the depth of its spiritual disease ; and this failure affects
his'entire conception of the restorative system which is revealed
throughout the New Testament, and in uo part of it more dis·
tinctly than in the Epistles of S. Paul.
