uncircumscribed (Eph. i. aa, 23), invisible (Col. i. 15), im·
mutable (1 Tim. i. 113 vi. 16). In the Old Testament the
Name os God represents the Divine Essence (Heb. i. 12); the
Gospel reveals the Persons of the Son and ol the Holy Ghost
as distinct from the Person of the Father although in essence
inseparable from Him (Eph. iv. 6). The coequal and con-
substantia} Deity os the Word (Phil. ii. 7 ; rThess. i. ιο) is
firmly and repeatedly maintained3 and the Holy Spirit, if less
frequently, is not less directly declared to be Very God (Eph. vi
Manand 17). (ii) The nieme-which Theodore identifies with Creation
the '‘⁶⁶²⁰“ (Rom viii. 19; 1 Cor. ii. 12), is regarded as an organic body,
whose members are partly rational and invisible, partly visible
and objects oi sense. Originally (Rom. viii. 19; Eph. i. ιο), this
body, notwithstanding the diversity os its component parts was at
peace within itsels. Angels, the invisible and intelligent powers ol
creation‚ were entru‘sted with the administration os the visible
universe, which they moved and controlled in the interests os
man (Eph. i. 103 it a ; Col. i. 16). Man, made of elements
belonging to both sides os creatiom was designed to be abond '
os union intemal to the κόσμος, knitting together in his single
nature its opposite factors (Rom viii 19; Eph. i. 103 Coti. 16),
to the intent that the universe might with one accord serve its
Man'stall. Creator and obey His laws. (iii) In man as he came lrom the
hands os God there was already the genn of possible disunion‚ ,
since he was from the first liable to death (Gal. ii. 15, 16). ·Yet
he might have continued imnt'brtal by c'ontinuing obedient (Gal i.
4). Death, as a matter of lact, supervened in consequence of
Adam's disobedience (Rom. viii. 19; Eph'i. 103 Col. i. 16).
Two results followed from our salt. (a) The union ol the visible
creation with the invisiblewas dissolved by the separation oi
body and soul in mam The angels were alienated lrom man,
both by reason ol his decline from God Whom they still obeyed‚
and because the material side ol his nature no longer preserved
its oneness with the spiritual Thus their control over the visible
world, hitherto exercised sor man's¹ advantage, was in danger ol
being abandoned, and the¹ harmony os the κόσμος completely
broken up (Rom. viii. 19; Eph. i. 105 Col i. 16). (b) With
regard to man himself, the ingress ol mortality gave occasion
to ever fresh acts os disobedience, sor it introduced a new state
os being-this present mortal lise (Gal. i. 4), in which perlection
is impossible. Mortality gives rise to weakness and mutability
