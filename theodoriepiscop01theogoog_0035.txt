xxvi THE MSS. ΟΝ WHlCll THIS EDITION IS BASED.

one side os the leaf with a hard point, with double bounding
lines on both inner and outer margin

The writing is in Lombardic minuscules oi the 9th century.
There are two hands: the first occupying the five unsigned
quires to the middle os the last page, whe're it is replaced by
the second which continues to the end os the volume. The first
hand is the holder, and, in some resp'eets, the more elegant; the
other rather heavier, but very even and regular. The spaces
which separate the words, though narrow, are sufficient The con-
tractions are os the ordinary character, and, as is usual at this
period, generally occur in the sacred names and titles and in
words of common use.

The system os punctuation varies slightly in the two hands
In the first, in common use are the sullpoint generally placed in
the middle os the line ol writing, a short horizontal curve or tick,

’ and the comma The second hand uses the fullpoint, the inverted
comma or oblique upstroke, the semicolon, simple and inverted,

¹ and the comma or 7-shaped stop. The comma or 7 is the
highest power. ¹The punctuation at the beginning os the volume
has in places been altered by a later hand.

The text has been corrected by contemporary hands, and also
by a hand using Caroline letters of the roth century. A hand
of the roth century has likewise marked in the margins passages
to be copied or read as lessons¹. ΑΙ few other marginal marks
of an ¹early date by readers or correctors also occur. The only
notes of later times are some.which are written in the margins
oi the Epistle to the Ephesians by an Italian hand late in the
14th century'.
