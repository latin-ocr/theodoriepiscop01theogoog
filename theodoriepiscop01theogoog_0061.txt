else than an abridgement of Ambrosiaster, although strangely
enough he does not appear to acknowledge the debt3 but of
Ambrose=Theodore there is again no trace. Another period of
a hundred years passes before we once more encounter Theodore
in the pages of a Latin commentator. When we do, the country
where we meet him is france, although the author who cites him
is an Italian by descent and education D’Achery‚ who first
gave Lanfranc’s brief commentary to the world in the year
1648¹, observed with surprise that the Ambrosian extracts on
the Epistle to the Galatians and the eight following Epistles
were not to be found in the extant works of Ambrose or in
Ambrosiaster, adding: “Magna mihi suspicio est Β. lanfranci
aeuo commentaria S. Ambrosii exstitisse quae ad nostra tempora
haudquaquam peruenerunt, uel latere alicubi'’ The mystery is
now explained 5 for with the exception of a few paragraphs on
Galatians, all Lanfranc’s extracts from “Ambrose’' upon these
nine Epistles appear in the Latin Theodore. It is clear that
Lanfranc had access at Bec to a complete copy of our translation,
or more probably to a MS. similar to Amb. 87, 88, and con-
taining Ambrosiaster on Romans—2 Corinthiam, supplemented
by the Latin Theodore on Galaticus—Philemon

Two or three sentences of this translation were noticed by-the
Benedictine editors of S. Ambrose in the works of a younger
contemporary of lanfranc, Ivo, Bp. of Chartres (an.1093-1115)'.
Ivo had been a pupil of Lanfranc at Bec; and though the
Theodorean passages he quotes are not to be found in lanfranc's
catena, it may reasonably be supposed that he derived them from
the MS. which supplied his master. Later in the twelfth century
the Latin Theodore is cited throughout the ten Epistles by
Robertus Scriba But Robert’s extracts for the most part are
obviously abbreviated from Lanfranc’s; and the few which are not
in the editions of the latter may have been derived from a fuller
MS. of Lanfranc possessed by the Abbey of Bridlington. Ihave
not noticcd any certain indication that the Prior of Bridlington
had access to a MS. of the Latin Tmodore

In the commentaries of Bruno (irra5), Hervaeus (†1149), and
PeterLombard(†1160), l have searched in vain for traces of an
acquaintance with our translation'.
