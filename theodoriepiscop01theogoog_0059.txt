which had arisen amongst the clergy of that country. The
Spaniards, however, resented the interference of a foreigner;
whereupon the Bishop wrote his concordantia to shew that the
Irish people were originally of Spanish extraction. “He enjoyed
his bishoprick but a short time (the writer adds), when the invasion
of the Moors drove him back to Rome and destroyed his epis
copal see. But the Pope provided him with a titular bishoprick
in England, by virtue of which he assisted at the Council before-

of investigating the truth of this story, but it rests upon the state·
merit of a credible writer, who asserts that he received it from
a friend who had had access to the MS.¹ The circumstances
are not improbable, sor the invasion of the Moors in 710 was
immediately preceded by a serious quarrel between the Spanish
Church and Rome, caused by the action of the King Witiza

Enarratiancs on S. Paul belong to the last days of his life at
Fulda and are said to have been finished about the year 842¹.
