position to the year 813¹. Lastly, the editio prr'rrceps' ol the
commentary of Sedulius was taken from a MS. which the editor
describes as adorandae uetustatis and which he had from the
then Abbat of Fulda. These facts seem to shew that another
Sedulius lived in the early partos the ninth century ; that he
vas very probably, as has been conjectured, one os the Irisb
scholars who were attracted to the court os Charles by the fame
of Alcuin 3 and that there is nothing to preclude and something
to encourage the supposition that he is identical with Sedulius
the Commentator. On the other hand, it is certainly possible
that the Commentator may have been the signatary of nn. 721⁸3
and there is a piece os evidence yet to be produced, which, it it
can be trusted, raises this possibility into the region ol the pro·
bable. ’

In Ware's Histary os the Writers cy‘ Ireland, edited by Harris
(Dublin, 1764), under the name oi the second Sedulius‘, mention
is made of a MS. then existing in Spain which contained a work
entitled Concordantia Ht'spaniac atque Hiberniae a Sedulio scoto
genere Hiberm'ensi et Episcopo Oreterrsi. The occasion os this treatise
is said to have been as follows Sedulius, who had acquired a
reputation from his expositions ol S. Matthew andos S Paul’s
Epistles, was sent by the Pope [Constantine 1. i] to Spain in
the character oi Bishop ol Oretum⁵, to settle some differences'
