least not improbable that he was the means ol transmitting to
Africa the commentary on Galatians and the nine following
Epistles. Once brought to Africa the hook would not have
wanted a translator. The names of the Carthaginien deacon
liberatus, and of the Bishops Primasius and Victor will readily
occur3 but it is uncertain whether any of these possessed a
sufficient knowledge ol Greek¹. Junilius'‚ although possibly a lay·
man and a jurist, may have been wiking, as be certainly was able,
to render this service to his party3 and there are some a parari
reasons for crediting him with the translation. Or the work may
have been due to some more obscure hand, the pastime ola
weary exile or incarceration endured on behalf of the Church’s
independence and the sanctity ol the dead. A perusal of Victors
Chronr'caa' will shew that at this period there were not a lew
African Churchmen qualified by their knowledge, zeal, and en-
lorced leisure for the performance ol this task. (d) The resem· (d) Adop-
