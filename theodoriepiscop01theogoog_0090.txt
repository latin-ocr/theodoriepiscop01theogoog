COMMENTARIES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES OF S. PAUL. lxxix

andin varied and massive learning he is unquestionably superior
to the Bishop os Mopsuestia. But Jerome lays no claim to origin·
ality‚ or rather· he repudiatas the claim at the very outset os his
commentary on the Galatians. His work is a digest os his vast
reading, principally based, as he tells us, on the labours of Origen.
The whole is doubtless moulded and coloured by his own genius,
and is thus placed above the level ol a mere compilation. But it
is the product of a scholars erudition, rather than of an inde
pendent interpreter's thought3 and this sact alone distinguishes
Jerorne's commentaries from Theodore's. The latter makes no
display of learning, and scarce ever refers to other writers except
for the purpose os resuting their views. He aima at expounding
S. Paul, rather than at iliustrating himy he brings little tobis task
beyond a particular method and a system of doctrine3 he truste
to his author to supply the rest. The result is not a learned
commentary, but a thoughtsul exposition. Fach has its place in
the exegetical literature of the Church 3 and whilst we could ill
afford to lose the ripe sruits os S. Jerome's prodigious industry,
they are sar from rendering the expository work of Theodore
superfluous, even where the two commentatore have travelled over
the same ground.

DOCTRINAL SYSTEM OF THEODORE As
EXHIBITED IN HIS EXPOSITION OF S. PAUL.

sorne length by Neander and Dorner ¹. It does not lie within the
province os this Introduction to attempt a complete examination
os his system os theology‚ although with the increased materials
which we nov possess such a worlr might perhaps be profitably
undertaken. My present business is to collect and arrange the
outlines of Theodore's doctrine so far as it is developed in his

commentaries upon the Pauline Epistles.
