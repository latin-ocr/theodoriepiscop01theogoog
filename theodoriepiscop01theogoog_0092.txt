Gal. 11. 15, 163 Eph. 11. 1ο). Thus as death came into the

world by sin, so is sin the consequence 01 our mortality (Eph. i.

73 iv. 223 et passche) 3 and in this sense Adam’s sin and death

are inherited by the whole race (Rom. v. 13). It is this mortal

state with the constant liability to sin which it entails, which S. Paul

Ι frequently designates the ‘flesh’ (Rom. vii. 5, 14 3 Gal. ii. 20 3 v.

15) 3 not intending by that term to ,accuse our nature (Rom.

xiii. 14), but indicatlng its present subjection to the reign 01 death.

. have been complete which fell short 01 restoring man to a sinless

immortality. Now the Mosaic Law was obviously inadequate
101 this work (Rom v. 13 ; Gal ii. 15 3 iv. 24), in the face 01
our natural weakness and mortality (Rom. viii. 3) 3 whilst in

a sinless and deathless state its prohibitions would be useless, .
1111 its ritual impossible (Gal. i. 43 iii. 13, 14). Its office,
therefore, was simply preparatory and paedagogic3 it detected
and condemned sin 3 it taught virtue3 it led men to expect a
Deliverer3 it trained the Jewish race to be the first evangelists

01 the world (Rom. vii. 7, 193 x. 14, 153 Gal. iii 23, 243 Eph.

ii. ro). To restore man, to restore in man the harmony 01 crea·
tion, nothing less was necessary than a reconstitution 01 the
xdopos3 a gathering together anew 01 111 things under a new
Head, who must be at once a sinless and immortal man, and
indissolubly united to God (Eph. 1. 103 Col. i 16). (ν) The Person ol
hope 01 this restoration, inspired by the Law and the Prophets, cmm·
was in due season (Eph. i. 10) realized by the Advent 01 Christ.

In Jesus 01 Nazareth (Heb. i. 9) the invisible Word, the Only
Begotten 01 the Father, manifested Himsels, dwelling in the
Man, and inseparably united to him (Col. i. 163 1Τ1111.111.16).
The Man Christ-for¹ in S. Paul’s Epistles the word 611111110-
quently represents the human nature (Eph. i. 7, 8, 15, 16), although

it may also include the idea 01 the indwelling Deity (Phil..ii. 8) ι
—the Man Christ is thus the visible image 01 the invisible
Godhead (Col. i. 15) 3 and on account 01 his union with the true
Son 01 God, he possesses the privileges 01 1 unique adoption,

10 that to him also the title 01 Son 01 God belongs (Gal. iv. 53
Col. 1. 13). Moreover‚ 101 the same reason, he is “the first-
