(a) ln his learned and brilliant prolegomena (Spr'etl'. Solesm. version
ip. xxxii) Cardinal Pitra speaks ¹of the African Bishop and Com· ffi‘l‘foo· ’
mentator Primasius as indebted to “ Hilary'’ (1.9. 19 the exposition (91191-

contained in the Corbie MS, and made up of Ambrosiaster on fflffi‘e’f

This remark led me to examine the commentary of Primasius

on Gal-Philemon with the view of detecting any references to

our author which might be latent there. I found many com-
ments of a decidedly Theodorean type ; but with few exceptions

they proved to have been taken almost verbatim from Pelagius¹.
Examples may be seen in Migne P. L. 68, coll. 587, 590, 593,

596, 599, 601, 604, 606, 627, 630, 653, 665, 668. However‚ in

coll 598, 638, 652, 653, 656, 665, there are partial coincidences

with Theodore, where Pelagius has nothing corresponding; audit
seems not unreasonable to suppose that Primasius, who was one

of the Africans who visited Constantinople in no. ·5 59 and signed

in 553 the Constr'tutum of Vigilius, had access to the original of
Theodore's commentary, and even brought a copy back with him

to Adrumetum. But his references to Theodore are in any case ¹
of too general a character to prove his acquaintance with the
Latin translation In fact, the evidence which they afford looks
rather the other way 3 for had the translation been accessible, why
should not Primasius lave cited it directly?
