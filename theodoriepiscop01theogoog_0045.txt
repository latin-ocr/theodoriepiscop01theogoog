· Robert of Bridlington are for critical purposes of little value.
· There are signs that Lanfrane’s Ms, like that which Rabanus
used, was closely related to C and H, approaching perhaps
nearest to the former. But both these compilers abbreviate their
author, reconstruct his sentences, and alter his language with so
much freedom that it isoften impossible to say what text they
may have had before them. Omissions of words necessary to
the sense are frequent, difficulties are evaded by the arbitrary
substitution of something more or less appropriate to the matter
in hand3 and thus the evidence falls us just where it is most
needed Here and there, however, Laufranc has either retained
or conjectured the true reading3 e. g. p. 33 praedr'cafum, where
both our MSS. have fallen into the prodigious blunder of repeat·
ing praeuan’catum from the previous line ; p. τότ abrogabat, where

It would seem as if the compilet had begun by simply transcribing
the MS. before him, but upon becoming aware of its serious

of the latter, and had endeavoured though with only partial
