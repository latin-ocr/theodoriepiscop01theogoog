Theodore’s matter in his own words 3. and though his commen-
tary often supplies a key to the meaning of the translation,
where the latter is obscured by the bungliifg of the translator
or the mistakes of copyists, it would usually be unsaie to at-
tempt the restoration of Theodote’s Greek from the pages oi
his pupil. (ii) It is not indiscriminate Theodoret, whose com
mentary was perhapswritten after the Council of Ephesus, holds
· aloof from the speculatione os Theodore when they would have
led him away from the Catholic saith. This will be clear sronr
a comparison of the two commentaries in almost any crucial
passage, e. g. Phil. it 6, sq. 3 Col. i 13, sq. ; 1 Tim. iii. 16. Even
in matters unconnected with doctrine Theodorei shews himself
capable of steering his own course, although he professes to be·
but a humble follower of “the holy fathers.” ⁴

Α few words may be added as to the* position which Theodore Theodora Ἴ

occupies amongst extant ancient commentatore upon the Epistles hehtgioss'

of S, Paul, . on S. Paul

(comm. on Gal. iv. 24, infra, pp. 7 3-7'6), coupled with his well (alortgen.
known sentiments as to the allegorical method of exegesis, differen-

tiates him at once from Origen; and this presumptionis borne

out, as we have seen, by the actual divergence of their lines of
interpretation. Our author seldom or never n'ses into the sphere

of the mystical. He is penetrated by the same spirit of gram-

matical precision, buthe lacks both the critical discemment and

the spiritual power of Origen. Yet he speaks with more authority

than the great Alexandrian 3 he takes a more definite airn. Origen
approaches the sacred text asa seeker after truth3 Theodore‚ as

one who has already found the lrey of knowledge a'nd who, thus
furnished, proceeds to unlock the treasures of S. Paul’s reaching

with almost entire confidence in the result ,

(b) Wirhs Chrysostom and Theodoret Theodore naturally (illachry-
has much in common; and the three principal representatives of {Sffiossff
the exegetical school of Antioch agree, as we have seen, both in
their treatment of many crucial passages, and in their general style.
Nevertheless, each has a sphere and a manner of his own. The
homiletic character of S. Chrysostom's expositions, manifested

even in his formal cominentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, is
