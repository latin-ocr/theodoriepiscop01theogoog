cause· of · our author's' peculiar manner ih the character of the
man rather thau in his circumstances or educatiou. An ardent
and ingenious mind, possessed by a crowd of ideas¹, which
it had hardly strength enough firmly to grasp or thoroughly to
work out, and, iu spite of its originality and sincerity, haunted
by ocoesional doubts as to. the trustworthiness of its own con-
clusious, and a hazy uncertainty as to their exact scope and
issue ¹, would go far to produce a style of writing such as Theo
dore's critics have detected in his works. His literary faults
were but the reflection of mental imperfectione which to some
extent vitiate his work as well as its style, his theology no less
than the form in which it is east. Yet they will easily be condoued
by those who realize the fearless honesty, the prodigious industry,

and the unquestionable power with which these defectsare more
than redeemed.

This criticism‚ written mo're than forty years ago, rests almost Reasons
exclusively upon the fragments supplied by Cramer’s catena. No tor ¹²5

amounting probably to about one-half of the whole commentary.

Under these circumstances there can be no presumption in re-
opening the question of Theodore’s capacity and achievements
as a commentator upon S Paul.

Of our author's careful attention to the language of the Epis Theo
tles there rs abundant evidence. (a) He repeatedly stops to doreseta
