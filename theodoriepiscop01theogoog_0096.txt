which is synonymous with our restoration to immortality (Rom.

xi. r5; Eph. i. 3, 13,14, 22, a3; Phil. iii. 15 5 Col. i. 283 iii.

sin and death? In the intention and will of God it doubtless

is so (Rom. v. 15; Gal. iv. 24); sor Christ appeared in the com·

mon nature ol all men and died for all alike (ι Tim. ii. 6; iii. 16).

Yet when He returns² He will come as a Judge‚ to administer
punishment as well as to distribute rewards (Rom. ii. 173 Eph.

ii. 5 5 2Thess. i. 8 ; 1 Tim. v. 23 ; Heb. x. 26) ; and this punish·

ment· Scripture calls perditrbn (Eph. ii. 5), and represents as

not temporary, but eternal (a Thess. i. 9). Whence then this
ultimate difference between man and man? Our predestination

must be ascribed to the mercy and grace ol God (Eph i. 4, 5;

a Tim. i. 9). Though man has a moral nature which knows

and approves what is good (Rom. ii. 15.; Gal ii. 15-163 Phil.¹

iv. 8), aud a free will to direct his choice (Ephi. 13-14) ; yet

his will is disabled by the weakness of a mortal' nature from

steadily pursuing virtue (Eph. it ιο), and needs the guidance

of revelation and the grace os the Spirit (Ram. vii. 195 Gal. ii.
15-—163 2 Tim. i. 7 ; Tit. iii. 6-7). The Love oi God fore·

knew who would use His grace might, and has elected them to

receive it3 os this election saith and Baptism are the tokens

and fruits (Rom. ira 105 rThess. i. 5; 2Tim. ii. ¹93 Tit i.

1-4.) But concurrence and cooperation are necessary on the

partos the elect (Phil. ii. 133 Col. i. 5), and much is left to
our own free choice and effort (Gat v. 185 a Tim. ii. 21);
whilst the reward oi future glory will in each case bear a direct
proportion to the saith and labours of the recipient (Phil i. 19 ς
1Tim. vi. Ι19).

F ew if any os these lines ot‘ dogmatic teaching have been brought How tar
to ⁸light by the recovery oi Theodore’s commentary on the minor §suffic-nt
Epistles. The extensiv'e fragments of his expositions os Genesis tary adds
the Gospels and the Epistle to the Romans had already made us {423}ssoe
acquainted with his doctrine of the Fall and Restoration os Man, with Theo·

the work of the Holy Spirit, the Church‚ the Sacraments and the {leffiffij

aud the treatise ou the Incarnation3 his teaching as to Predesti·
