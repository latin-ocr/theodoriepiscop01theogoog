My next business is to ascertain how far the Latin version
may be trusted as a faithful representation of the lost original.
1 shall also endeavour to answer certain questions connected
with its literary character and history.

By comparing with the translation the Greek extracta in Relation
Cramer's catena we are enabled to form some estimate of orthq ,
the fidelity of both catenist and translator. As we might have {affin ,
expected, the former has usually abridged his original by omitting ²⁰}in
words, paragrapho, or larger portions of the text (Gal. ii. 20 3οῐιὲἲ ’
111 19, 13, 27, 183 iv. 1-3, 6, 13, 11, 303 v. 16311. 163
Ερ1111313 i 1, 1, 3, 4, 3, 13311. 16, &c); less frequently by
remodelling sentences (e. g. Gat iv. 14 3 vi. 2; Col. i. ¹5 3 1 Tim.

v. 3). Of an attempt to explain adifliculty by paraphrasing I have

noticed a very occasional instance (e. g. on Tit i. 12, 13, where

nin seems to have been substituted for the more obscure phrase
ἄποδίχεαθαι τᾶν ποιητὴν ais de...elppx6ra). Generally speaking,
the catenist appears tohave confined himself to Theodore’s words 3
and hebes thus frequently ussisted toward the correction of the
errore into which the translator or his copyist had fallen, or has

supplied what was wanting in the Latin (Gal. i. 15, 163 ii. 203
11141311. 193 vi. 173 Eph. i. 10313, 143 ii. 14-16311. 4;

Of the substantial integrity of the translation as it appears sub-

in our MSS„ there is no reason to entertain any doubt. Here 1111111
