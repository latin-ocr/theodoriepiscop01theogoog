of that new creation which he has inaugurated‚ and in the future
world he will be adored by all (Gal. iii. 27, 283 Eph. i. ro, 20 3
Phil. ii. 10, rr). Tm assumption of human flesh by God the
Word is a reality3 the visible Christ was no phantom the “ form
of a servant'’ signifies our human nature, as “the formos God’'
signifies the Nature ol God 3 the “likeness os man’' in which
Our Lord was formed was true Man (Phil. ii. 7 3 rTim. iii. 163
2 Tim. ii. 8). But isit be asked in what sense God dwelt in
this Man, we must reply that it was by a special disposition
towards him, a disposition os entire complacency (Eph. i. 22, 23 ;
iv. 9). God, in His uncircumscribed Nature and Essence‚ fills
the universe, nay, is all in all; in Christ, He dwells in the Person
of the Word by a moral union so unexampled and complete,
that the Divine Word and the Humanity which He assumed
are constantly regarded as being One person (Rom. i. 2—3;
Phil. ii. 83 rTim. iii. 16). (vi) The Man who thus became the
habitation oi God the Word received at his Baptism the further
indwelling of God the Holy Gnost, by Whose power he wrought
miracles, attained to moral perfeetion, and accomplished all that was
necessary t‘or the salvation os mankind (r Tim. iii 16). At length
He submitted to death, in such wise however that the indwelling
Godhead was not exposed to the contact ol mortality (Heb. ii.
9 puple θεοΰ]). The Man died. both because death isan ac-
cident os humanity (Phil. ii. 8), aud also with the Divinely sore
seen purpose ol paying the debt· which was due to the Law
on the score os human sin (Gal. iii. 12 ; iv. 4-5), os vanquishlng
the Devil and delivering mankind from his grasp (Eph. iv. 8), and
of securing lor the race a sinless immortality (Rom. viii. 3 ; Eph. i.
7 3 ii. 13, 163 Col. ii ιι). He died that He might rise from the
dead, and conquer death (Gal. v. 11). Our nature died in Him
and rose again (Rom. vi. 6 3 Col. ii. 14 ; iii. 3); He is the first·
fruits os risen humanity, “the firstborn from the dead” (Eph. i.
63 Col. i 18). Such is the power of His resurrection that it will
effectuate the resurrection os all mankind (Phil. iii. ιο), and thus
reunite creation, rent asunder by human mortality (Col. i 205
The ii. 15). (vii) Christ( Himself united to God, unites believers to
charon, Himself in the community oi His Body‚ the Church. Not only

the Sacra·

ments, and by sharing our nature, but by imparting to us His Spirit, He enters

theelgrs- into a close relationship with us, like that os the head to the

members or of the husband to the wife (1 Cor. xi. 3: Gal. iii.

tian li

29; Eph. i 22, 23; ii ⁶3 iii. 19; iv. 15, 16; v. 23, sq.).
