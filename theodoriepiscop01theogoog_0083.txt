lxxll RELATION OF THIS COMMENTARv ΤΟ OTHER

passages 1 have shewn reason to suppose that amongst the writers
thus attached are possibly Origen,¹ Chrysostom, Severianus, and
Pelagius3 and if this be so, Theodore may at least receive
credit for impartiality. Once or twice he holds the balance al-
most evenly between the opposite views os contemporaries (Gal.
ii. 11-143 Eph. v. 14) ; but as a rule his own opinion is given
in unmistalreable terms, and he is not afraid to stand almost or
altogether alone.

Qualified That he was occasionally indebted to other commentators is

ls'ffi* probable enough. As to Origen, a comparison ol the fragments

debu ro ol his expositions of S. Paul¹ with the translated Theodore ¹shews

ssfflgl· but few coincidences, and those chiefly in points os grammar and

Emis, Se· punctuation' ; the exegesis usually differs altogether. Eusebius of
{flffiysr Emisa († o 359) may have suggested some ol our author's re·
costum, marks on the Epistle to the Galatiahs either directly or through

Diodore. Diodore, who is said by S. Jerome to have followed in Eusebius’s

steps⁸. Severianus, il we may judge ol his work by the extracts in
Cramer, was osten at one with Theodore¹ ; but the coincidences
are probably due to the connexion os both writers with the same

exegetical school. With regard to his sriend Chrysostom⁶, whilst Ἴ

T heodore is frequently on the same lines with him ·(e.g. in com·
menting on Gal. iv. 17 5 v. 23 ; Eph. iv. 6 3 vi. 243 Phil. ii. 165 iii. 2 ;
Col. i. 20; iv. 16, 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4), their explanations are nearly
as osten distinct, and sometimes they are opposite (Phil. iii 193
Col. i. 13, 15, &c.). His debt to their common master Diodore
is probably greater, and its extent can be tested up to a certain
point. Diodore wrote commentaries on S. Paul which were
extant in S. Jerome's time, but were afterwards destroyed, it is
said, by An‘an intolerance. A few fragments ol his commentary
on the Epistle to the Romans have been preserved, and are
printed in Cramer’s Catena It happens that in s'everal instances
fragments os Theodore's expositions of the same passages sur-
vive ; on the next page Ι give the results of a comparison where
it has thus become possible.
