partly from the representations of his enemies. I have usually
been able to illustrate the doctrina! statements of the text from
. one or other of these sources: and it will be ,observed that the
author himself frequently refers to some earlier work, especially to
his commentary upon the great dogmatic Epistle to the Romans.
But if Cardinal Pitra’s discovery does not add much to the
’ extent of our knowledge of Theodore’s doctrina] system, at least
it enables us to verify previous impressions and to fill up missing
links, by presenting the whole in a more continuous form than it
assumes elsewhere. The commentary on the minor Prophets is
the only other work of the great Interpreter which remains in its
integrity; and it is of comparatively little dogmatic interest.
Hitherto our view of his teaching has been chiefly drawn from
fragments the preservation of which is due to the arbitrary choice
of catenists or to the aalmus of bitter opponents. In this work at
length Theodore speaks for himself without interruption; and the
subject compels him to traverse almost the whole field of Christian
doctrine.

Remarlrs The relation of Theodore’s doctrine to the teaching of the
onTheo- Church on the one hand, and of various heretical leaders
{liryirgnsapoy on the other, has been too often discussed to need any fresh
toacher. examination here. I shall content myself with calling attention
to two points which have been impressed upon me by the study of

the present Commentary.
His de· (l) That Theodore's teaching, or rather perhaps the Antiochene
fffiffe theology of which he was the ripest exponent, contained in itself
saith olthe the germs of manifold departures from the Catholic saith, it is
{fflfm impossible to doubt. A suggestive writer in the Church Quarterly
consciens. Reuiew (Oct. 187 5) has pointed out that some of the most recent
developments of unbelief are but the working out of principles
enunciated in the fifth century by the Bishop ol Mopsuestia 3 and
the connexion which the reviewer has traced between “Theodore
and Modern Thought'' might be found in other tendencies besides
those which he has noticed. Nevertheless, every accession to our
knowledge of Theodore, and this not the least, adds strength to
the conviction that he was entirely unconscious of deviating
from the doctrine of the Catholic Church. So far is hesrom being
a wilful hereric, that it is the very vigour of his opposition to
recognized heresies which leads him astray. His Christology is
meant to be a safeguard against Apollinarianism ; his sympathy

vvith Pelagius arises from a dread of fatalism ; his rejection
