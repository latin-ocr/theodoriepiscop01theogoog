ln tfive of these specimens Theodore appears to have seized
the idea presented by Diodore, but to have worked it out in a
characteristic manner3 ‘in (c) he has distinctly set aside his master's ’
interpretation in favour of one which fits in with his own more
elaborate system ol theology. ,whether the coincidences are due
toa direct use of Diodore's commentary or to recollections of his
teaching‚ it is impossible to ascertain 3 but their very partial charac-
ter encourages the belief that Theodore's work is iar srom being a
mere echo oi either.
Question Τὴε relation which Theodore’s commentary bears to the· briei
gffissm notes now generally ascribed to Pelagius, is perplexing. There
toPelagi· are passages in the latter where it seems difficolt to deny the
³³· influence of Theodore, unless we assume either that Theodore
had seen the worlr of Pelagius, or that they drew from a common

source¹. Compare the following extracts:

(a) Gal. ii. 2.

'¹ msme...hoc non est dubitantis.” ⁴⁸ nam quod dicitur nequaque nudo.
non dubitationis causa dicitur.'’
