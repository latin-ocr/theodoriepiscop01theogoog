Library, Cambridge, lor assistance os various kinds liberally

rendered to me in the course of my labours. To Mr Bensly,

Fellow and Lecturer in Hebrew and Syriae ol Gonville and Caius

College, I owe the first suggestion of the work; he has moreover

revised the Syriae quotations in my Introduction and notes,
and offered an occasional criticism upon the Latin text. The

prooi-sheets of the first two Epistles and of ¹a great part of the

third have been read through by Mr Wallis, Fellow and Lec-

turer in Divinity of the same College; and to his vigilance Ι

am indebted sor not a few important corrections together

with suggestions which have here and there, in passages

ambiguous or corrupt, set me upon the track oi Theodore’s or .
’ his translator’s meaning.

Notwithstanding this kind help, Ῑ have osten been at a loss
to penetrate the obscurity as well oi the translation asos the
original work. In the addenda a'list will be found of pas-
sages where, upon fuller consideration, I have been led to
prefer another reading or explanation to the one which had
been hazarded when the sheets'were printed off. Other errors
or dubious points may remain; and Ι shall thankfully add to
the second volume any emendations oi the text or corrections
of the notes with which Ι may be savoured.

It remains lor me only to express my grateful sense oi
the liberality with which the Syndics os the University
Press undertook, at my request, the publication os my book3
and the uniform courtesy and unwearied attention which

the officials os the Press have displayed during the progressos
the work.
