P'REFACE.

THE task of preparing for the press this edition of Theodoro
of Mopsuestia's newly recovered commentary upon the minor
Epistles of S. Paul was taken in hand early in the year 1875.

r Its completion has been ,delayed partly by the laborious and

‘ intricate nature ¹of the work, partly by unforeseen circumstances

’ which brought upon me abundant occupation of another kind.

- As a foreign editr'on which was designed to embrace the greater
part of the commentary had been discontinued on the under-
s standing that the present work would shortly be ready for
publication, it was thought right to issue the first volume
at once. The second volume, if I am permitted to finish it,

=. will follow in the course of another year, and will contain,
’ besides the remainder of the commentam, an appendix and
indices.

1 have endeavoured to acknowledge particular obligations,
as they have occurred. My thanks are more especially due
to Professor Jacobi of the University of Halle, M. Garnier,
,Ι *Librarian of the Bibliotheque Communale at Amiens,
’κ Dr Ceriani, Librarian of the Ambrosian Library at Milan,

’ζ Dr Ignazio Guidi of Rome, Mr E. Maunde Thompson, Keeper

of the MSS. at the British Museum‚ Professors Hort and Mayor
of Cambridge, and Mr Bradshaw‚.Librarian of the University
