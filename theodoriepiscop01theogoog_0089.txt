altogether absent from those of his friend In the work before us
there are no impassioned appeals, no homethrusts at the con-
science of hearers ot readers, and comparatively few discursive
references to prevailing heresies and to the customs of the age.
Th0ugh byrro means free from a tendency to ramble‚ Theodore
aims more directly than S. Chrysostom at the character of a com-
mentator proper. Theodoret on the other hand holds a middle
place between the commentator ond the compiler. He is neither ·
homiletic nor discursive ; he does not blindly follow either of his
guidem sometimes he chooses between them when they disagree‚
sometimes he rejects both His notes are usually good and
pointed, but tliey are notes merely¹ ; we desiderate in him the
originality, the courage‚ and in places the fulness and thoroughness
of his master. Theodore is less safe than Theodoret, less amenable
to the restraints of authority, less terse in style, often less clear3
but he is vastly the superior of the latter in genius and in exposi-
tory power. Among the three Antiocheam, if S. Chrysostom is
the type of the homilist‚ andTheodoret of the annotator, Theodore
may, in spite of his many faults of style and partial views os the
Truth‚ fairly claim the title which a large section of Eastern
Christendom has assigned to him. It is his one aim and purpose
to be S. Panl's ‘Interpreter.'

(c) Ambro- (c) Two Latin commentaries of a somewhat earlier date offer

ἓὴῗξζοᾞ points of comparison with the present work The writer known
as Ambrosiaster, who, whatever his real name and position in the
Church, stands in the forefront of ancient Western expositors,
resembles Theodore in so far as heis an acute observet of the
words and the drift of the sacred text, and follows the historical
rather than the allegorical or mystical method of interpretation.
Like Theodore, too, he is rich in apposite illustrations drawn from
other portions of Scripture. But he is briefer, weightier, less dis
cursive, less systematic, than the Greek commentator3 whilst on
the other hand Theodore throws more individuality into his work,
aims more constantly at presenting a connected view of the
Apostle’s' thought and teaching,and uses with considerable judgment
the advantage which he possesses of free access to the Greek
text of the Epistlea

We possess commentaries by S. Jerome on four of the ten

Epistles represented in the Latin Theodore. In vigour of language
