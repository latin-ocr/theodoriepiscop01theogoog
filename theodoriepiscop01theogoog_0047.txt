xxxvi INTEGRITY, PECUMARITIES, AND HISTORY

sair field for enquiry (eg. the comment on 1 Tim. iii. 8), we may
suppose that the translator· aimed at giving a complete version,
correspondiug line by line with his original, and faithfully reflect-
ing its sense¹. How lar, it may be asked, has he succeeded in
is intention?
lnstanoes th In not a few instances he haswithout doubt misunderstood or
:geometr inadequately expressed the meaning of the Greek (Gal. i. 3-5;
translator iv. 253 Eph i. 8-10 3 Phil. i. r, 2 [obv ἐπισκόποις, coepiscopis],
{raelairteed 12-143 Col. i. 27 3 ii. 13, 233 iii3 3 1Thess. iv. 5), or has
senttbis obscured the sense by misplacing a word or a dependent
225? clause (as tunc, Gal. iv. 1—-3 5 circavi. 16 3 quifiet in melius,
Phil. ii. 15); or offered a paraphrase rather than translation (as ol
ποῦ ποτε στήσεται obruit Gal. iv. 19 3 ὁμοίως ἐμοί, Phil iii. 173
πρὸς ἆνειδιαιπολὴν ἐκείνων, t Thess i. ιο ; adv τοιοῦτον, 1 Tim.
iii. 2); or changed the construction (Gal iv. ²45 v. 8 5 Eph. i.
13, 143 ii. aa, dte.) 3 οι manifested carelessness in the choice ot
conjunctione, using nam for δέ (Eph. iii. 19), and autem lor γάρ
(1 Tim. iii. 2, bit). Again, a remarkable disregard for the amenities

‚os composition is shewn in his reuden’ng ol certain unimportant
passages, such as Theodore's brief comments upon the saluta
tious at the end of the several Epistles; whilst in abstruse dog-

matic passages (e. g. Phil. ii. 6 sq.; Col. i. 13 sq.), though he
labours to do his best, his powers are unequal to the taslr ot

fflff' the other hand his conscientiousuess is proved by (a) the sre-

general quent use os an alternative or a double rendering (eg. διάστημα,
