Most 01 these 011010 and corrections are doubtless due to
Rabanus or his copyists3 a 1011 may be chargeable 10 his editor.
The MS. irom which Rabanus 111011 seems 10 have been 0001 01
kin to the archetype 01 Cand H. It shared their errors; ’111
common with them both it gave seipsis ceteros 101 seipsos caten‘s
(p. 201), contemplationem 101 contmplanbne (p. 205), imponatis
101 pritan's (p. 207), laborem 101 laborum, dispensationem 101 despe-
rationem (p. 210), ur'tam 101 uos (p. 212), concedebant 101 condece-
bant (p. 218), drinium 101 r'ndriu'sam (p. 220), farti 101 sorte (223).
Nearly iorty such coincidenoes may be found in the commentary
on the Epistle to the Philippians alone. lt shared their omis-
sions; examples may be seen 00 pp. 201, 217, 255, 251. In
one remarkable instance it agreed with our MSS. in inserting
awhple verse 01 the Epistle at a wrong place ,- see p. 216,1. 14,
note. This case seems to shew that Rabanus's copy was an
earlier one than the archetype 01 C and H, since a double error

¹ which occurred in the Fulda MS. had been partly corrected 10
the MS from which both C and H 11010 derived·

Where the Corbie and Harley MSS. 010 01 10110000, the
MS. used by Rabanus sided sometimes 'with the one,· sometimes
with the other, but most frequently 111111 C. An earlier copy 111011 ,
either C or H, 11 would seem to 11010 had more affinity 10 the MS. -
11001 which C was transcribed, than to the original 01 H Where
it differs 110111 both, 11 occasionally presents 0 singular coincidence
with the corrections 01 c; see e. g. p. 245, where 101 secundam
Rabanus and the Corbie corrector give sed cum.
