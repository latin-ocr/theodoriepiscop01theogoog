Library came from the same place. '’

To this full and lucid statement of the palaeographical features
os the Harley Ms, it is only necessary to add some particulare as
to its contente The eight quires missing from the beginning
appear to have been occupied by the commentary of Ambrosiaster

on Romans, 1 Corinthians and a Cor. i. 1—173 for the first page ·

of the existing volume begins with the words “[appa]ratibus
uincitur quod apostolus semper spreuit,'' tte-part of Ambrosi-
asters exposition of that verse ’ς and this commentary proceeds
without break as far as the prologue to the Galatians, where the
latin Theodoro takes its place. It is worthy of note that the
second hand of which Mr Thompson speaks replaoes the first
precisely where the Theodorean matter begins, and without the
slightest interruptim, the first two words of the prologue to
Galatians (⁶⁶ Beatus apostolus '') completing the line in which the
commentary of Ambrosiaster on a Cor. had come to an end.
The following is the order in which the Theodore is distributed:
Galatians (i), ff. 38 b-60b: (ii), 60 b-75 b; Ephesians, 75 b·-
97 b; Philippians, 97 b-111b3 Colossians, 111 b-rafi a;

capitula, which accord generally with the system adopted in the
best MSS. of the Vulgate 3 in two of the three instances where
