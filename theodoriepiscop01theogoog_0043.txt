sities. It manifesta a tendency to interpolate words, sometimes
to the detriment of the sense; eg. p. 22 euidens ratio est ς ²7
hinc mas delectatio uoluptatum3 ²9 dr legitimo decreto; 30 caneri
κ oporter,· 31 in praesenti υἱέας 39 de illis. In the text of the ’
Epistles there is an occasional attempt to conform to the Vulgata
(p. 71 legistis for audatia· 263 praedestinanti· for praeordraaurt).
On the other hand the Corbie MS. or its archetype endeavours to
correct grammatical irregularities, eg. it substitutes Petra piguit
for Petrus p. (p. 20); its usual preference of mart for admotis
probably due to this cause. In the order of the words, also, H
is often, I thi'nlr, the safer guide; Chaving frequently replaced
the original sequence by one more customary and agreeable to

the ear.
(5) Ortho- (5) In the matter of orthography, it may be sufficient to notice
graphy. that H usually adopts assimilation, whilst C (prima mana) in
many cases rejects it. Bnt neither MS. follows any absolute rule,
or is quite consistent with itself in every particular case. Where
the MSS agree in regard to any word or class of words, I have
generally followed their guidance; where they differ, the printed
tert for the most part accords with C, which, as being the more
carefully written of the two MSS. and affording the purer text,
has been accepted on the whole as the basis of the present edition.
Compari· The Latin text of the commentary as it appears in Rabanus
{222¹}ss Maunts¹ offers a considerable number of variations from the MS.
Commen- authorities In Philippians alone I have noticed nearly 100
“iffi instances in which Rabanns departs from the text presented by
{canui both ¹C and H. Occasionally the compilet has without doubt
ffigfof preserved the true reading (eg. p. 198 ad amandam, exr‘stimabat,·
CandH. eoasacr'ebat,· 243 carso‘rati, alterutram), or a trace of it (p. 197
amdaaty 200 aila). But the great majority of these divergences
are attributable to error or design. Attempts are repeatedly made
to emend either orthography or grammar 3 thus dracmas is substi-
tuted for dracones, episcopos arans for ‘epr'scopis’ dame, ductus est
Romam for da. Romae, aaa...in allo for nam...ia nulla, lucra for
lucras, lucratam essa for lucrasse, necessaria for aaassarie, aurbus
