cesssul in directing attention to the soree of subordinate words*

aud clauses. Itis a principle with him that in S. Paul’s writings
not a clause 01 a word is without its soree or bearing 011 the
argument—nothing is added ἁπλῶς (absolute); and the endeavour
to carry out this principle leads him to suggest references which are
21 once original and interesting, ir not always probable Com-
pare his remarks 011 πνεύματος, Gal. wi. 183 πάσης, 1 Thess. iv. 33

iv. 6. (e) His admiration 101 the Apostle is genuine, and rises
at times to an enthusiasm which expresses itself in the warmest
terms (Gal. iii ²93 iv. 213 1 Tim. i. 33 see especially Philemon,
9); but it does 1101 prevent him 110111 recogniziug the rugged
brevity 01 S. Paul's style, and the obscurity which sometimes
results srom the struggling 01 so many great thoughts 101 simul-
taneous utterance (Rom. ix. 22, sq.; Gal v. 4, 12 ; Eph. iii. 4;
1Tim.i 3—43 iv. 3). He makes it a part 01 his businessas
an expositor 10 point out what he considers to be the Apostle's
characteristics (ἰδιώματα, proprietates), the frequent parenthesis,
the ecbatic ivo, the vehement μή γένοιτο, the occasional com·
mingling 01 incompatible metaphora, the broken elliptical sorm ¹
01 many 01 the sentences (Rom. ix 22 5 Gal. ii. 4, 9, 173 iii.
13-14 3 Eph. 11. 11—-123 1 Tim. i. 3—4).

It is however in his‘logical rather than in his grammati· Hiren-
cal and lexical treatment 01 the Epistles that Theodore's{ffiffito
power chiefly shews itsels. His interest in thelanguage is pro- the se·
fessedly subordinate 10 his interest in the thought which it en· {ffiffs
shrines (Eph. ii. 12). He is never weary 01 pointing out to the
reader the undercurrent 01 close reasoning which pervades
SPaul’s letters. Tbis is done by various methods. (a) A care·
fully constructed argument is prefixed to each Epistle. By sar
the most striking as well as the longest arguments are those
which occur at the opening 01 the Epistles to the Ephesians and
10 Philemon; but not one 01 the Epistles represented in the
Latin translation is without such an introduction. These argu-
ments not only deal with the occasion and purpose 01 the Epistles,
but sketch out their plan. More than once good service is done
by them in the way 01 comparing Epistles 01 kindred subjects
or character, and noticing the points 01 00111201 and 01 dissilience
