these commentaries at least some years after his consecration to the
Episcopate. (b) From internal evidence it is certain that Theo
dore's commentaries on the Epistles were written after his corn-
'mentaries on the Gospels (comm. on Col. i. 17 3 1 Tim. i. 4 ; iii.
16). Moreover the manner in which our author cites the Pentateuch
and the Prophets suggests that those portions of the Old Testament
as well as the Psalms had already been made the subject of
critical study (common Gal. iv. 253 Eph. i. 22 ; iii. 19 ; vi. 17;
Coti. 15, 163 1 Tim. v. 19)¹. (c) The cautious balancing of
opinions on the scene at Antioch which finds place in Theodore’s
commentary on Gal ii. 11-14 seems certainly to have been
framed in view of the correspondence which had passed between
S. Chrysostom and S. Jerome in the year 404. Again, the frequent
probable references to opinions expressed in the writings of
Chrysostom and Severianus point to a date not earlier than the
first decade of the fifth century ς andis we suppose that Theo
dore was also acquainted with the commentary of Pelagius,
our terminus a quo must be pushed on to the year 411 or 41²·
Further, there are not wanting signs that Theodore, at the time ,
ol writing, was beginning to excite suspicion, perhaps on account
of his sympathy with the Pelagian party (cf. eg. infra, p. 208,
l. 6, note) ; in which case nn 415 will be the earliest possible date.
(d) Lastly, the fully developed views of the writer on points
as well of doctrine⁹ as of discipline, and the completeness of the
theological system which his work reveals, seem to mark it as the
result pf his matured thought

None of these indications of date, taken by itself, can be
urged as conclusive ; but their cumulative weight is, I venture
to think, considerable. Until proof is adduced to the contrary
we may safely regard these conrmentaries as among the latest
ol Theodore’s expository works.
