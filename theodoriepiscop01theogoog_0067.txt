doubtfully, that Felix of Urgel had been influenced by the
writings of the Bishop of Mopsuestia, which in that case
might have reached him from Africa in a Latin fonn. The
extant remains of Felix are too brief to allow os the theory being
either supported or disproved. But supposing that Latin transla-
tions of Theodore were at this period circulated iu Spain, which
is not improbable, it seems not quite certain that we must look
to Africa as the source from which these translations came. There -
is the alternative that they were executed in Spain during the
age which preceded the outbreak of Adoptianism. Influences
had long been at work within the Spanish Church which pre-
disposed her to this form os heresy; her weary struggle with
Priscillianists, Sabellians and Ariaus, her remarkable interest
in dogmatic speculations, her partial isolation, manifesting it-
self in a certain independence of Christian lise and thought,
all contributed to this result¹. Elipandus was able to appeal
to expressions in the national liturgy which appeared to give
countenance to his view¹. One Spanish Bishop at least seems
to have anticipated the conclusions os the Adoptianists by one
hundred 3ηά fifty years³. Theodiscus, the successor of S. Isidore
at Seville, was deposed and banished 'for teaching that “Our
Lord is not One God with the Father and the Holy Spirit but
rather an adopted Son '’-a statement which he probably meant
to apply only to the Human Nature of Christ. According to the
chronicler‚ this forerunner of the party os Felix and ‚Elipandus
was 3 “Greek by descent, and skilled in a variety ol languages ,³²

and heis charged with having salsified some posthumous works ·

of his predecessor, and procured their translation into Arabic 'in
this altered form. Such 3 person would not have scrupled to
circulate Theodore's commentary under the name os Ambrose⁴3

to form any certain conclusion with 96, 874, sq.).
