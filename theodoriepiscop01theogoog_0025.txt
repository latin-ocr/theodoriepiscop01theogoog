s . matter is arranged throughout 'in double columns; the text of

the Epistles, embedded in the commentary, is distinguished by

-313b are filled by an anonymous and imperfect θεωρία υροιι the

Tabernacle¹, which seems to have been added by way of an Ι

appendix to the commentary on Hebrews ix.

Four of the Epistles are followed by colophons stating the
sources from which the catenist has horrowed. At the end of
Ephesians we read: τοῖν είς τὴν πρός Ἐφεσίους ἐπιστολήν Παύλου

Eusebius of Emisa contributes about a dozen short extracts, whilst
SS. Athanasius, Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzos, are each quoted
once. There are also some twelve anonymous fragments which
apparently are not due to Theodore. Origen is largely quoted ou
the Epistle to the Ephesians, but his name does not occur else
