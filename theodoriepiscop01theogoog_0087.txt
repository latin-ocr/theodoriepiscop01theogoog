lxxvl RELATION OF THIS COMMENTARY TO OTHER

PELAGIUS. THEODORE.
(J) Tit. i. 7.
“ipsum dicit episcopum quem supe· “nam dum dicit: ut tantalum...
riuspresbyterum nominauit.'’ presbyteros, et de presbyteris dispu-
tans adiecit: operm enim (piscopuna,'’
dac.

Several of these comments, indeed, are‘fouud also in S. Chry-
sostom‚ and one or two in other and earlier Greek writers, srom
whom Pelagius may have borrowed them. But it is not so easy to
account for the coincidences in the doctrinal statements marked l
(d), (s) [in part], (g), and (h). The last of these, in particular,
advances a view denounced by Chrysostom‚ and, as far as I know,
peculiar in their own age to Pelagius and Theodore. Moreover,
in both commentaries it is supported by areference to Exod. iv.

22. Now the commentary of Pelagius is known to have been
written before the year 410, and while he was yet at Rome, where
Theodore’s work would scarcely have reached him, even if it had
then been made public. It seems more probable that Theodore
was here and there indebted to Pelagius. The latter took up
his abode in Palestine soon after the publication of his com· -
mentary; and from Palestine the book might have been conveyed
to Antioch and Mopsuestia. That Theodore possessed some
acquaintance with Latin is not· unlikely, and indeed is suggested
by his commentary ou 2 Tim. iv. 13, where he traces the word
μεμβράνας to the Latin original '

· Theodo- ·But whether or nothe borrowed anything from the pages
ἑξῖξοζξιζο of Diodore aud Pelagius, it is unquestionable that Theodore '
'theodora himself found at least one almost contemporary expositor to

tread closely in his steps. Long bespre the appearance of Cramer’s
Catenae and Pitra's Spicilegium‚ Richard Simon expressed his con-
viction that Theodoret had.consulted Theodore as well as Chry-
sostom¹. This is now placed beyond a doubt. The Bishop of
Cyrrhus followed the Bishop of Mopsuestia far more nearly
than the latter followed the Bishop of Tarsus. Abundant ex·
amplos have been given ‚in the notes and it would be super-
fluous to repeat them here. But two remarks are necessary to
indicate the nature aud extent of the imitation. (i) It seldom

if ever amounts to a werbal reproduction. Theodoret recasts
