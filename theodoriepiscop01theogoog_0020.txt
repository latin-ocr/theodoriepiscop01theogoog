however, convinciugly disproyed by Prof. J. 1. Jacobi, of Halle,
in two articles which appeared in the Deutsche Zeitschrifl fiir
chn'rtltike Wt'ssertrchaft und chn'stlichrs Leben for Aug. 5—12,
1854¹3 and the work was shewn to be a translation ol a Greek
commentary, of which the original was due to the exegetical school
of Antioch and to its greatest expositor, Theodora. Dr Jacobi's
essay was followed in 1859 by an article in the Cambridge souma!
of Classical and Sacred Philology', in which the same conclusion ·
was quite independently reached by the Rev. F. J. a Hort.
Mr (now Professor) Hort was guided to the Theodorean author-
ship of the new commentary partly by the nature of its contents,
partly by the character ol‘ the text of S. Paul's Epistles which
it exhibited⁸. Both in Prof. Jacobi’s and in Mr Hort’s essays
the identification was elenched and placed beyond reasonable
doubt by a reference, in Mr Hort's article worked out with some
minuteness -of detail ⁴, to the Greek fragments of Theodore’s
commentary already printed in Dr Cramer’s Catenae Graecorum
Petrum.

Within the last few years the interest excited by this dis·
covery has been revived through the detection by Dr Hort of
another copy of the same commentary among the MSS. of the
Harley collection at the British Museum⁵. This second MS.
seems to be somewhat earlier than the first; and though less
carefully written and perhaps less trustworthy as a whole, it is a
valuable witness in rnany places where the Corbie MS. is corrupt
or doubtful, and it has occasionally supplied words or even lines
which were wanting in the latter. A third MS. is now known
to exist in one of the private libraries of Europe⁶3 but its
