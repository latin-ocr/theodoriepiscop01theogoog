stated this view in the essay to which reference has already been
made. “On the whole '', he writes l Journal of Class. and Sacred
Philol, p, 308), the translator may be sought with more probability
in the monasteries of Gaul which propagated the learning and

the way for the reception of the works of a man so closely con-

as Theodore. Moreover his own monastery of Marseilles pro
